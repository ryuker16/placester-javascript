Placester-Javascript
==========================

This one was fairly easy to solve. I completed all extra credit too. It will take
anything such as more operators or parenthesis.

Bug fixes....fixed:

1. Spelling errors and bad grammar
2. Turned Equation into a proper constructor with arguments
3. Replaced 2/3 of the prototype functions with one called calcAll
that grabs all current values of the fields at run time as arguments for Equation.
CalcAll is the only function that runs when a change to any field occurs
4. Added error message if user's query doesn't result in number
5. Anwser won't display "NaN" or "undefined" since it will only display valid results
6. Ensured the calculator only runs after DOM is actually loaded.
